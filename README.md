# Pizza Time

### Express server for ordering a pizza

## Setup

npm install
npm run load
npm run start

## How to use

Through sending HTTP requests,
you should be able to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) Pizzas and Orders

## To Fix

This app is not fully functional.  
There may be bugs, there may be unfinished features (hint: there should be some way the pizza company can figure out how to contact the customer)

## Bonus

If you finish fixing all the issues and still want to continue, choose one or more of the following new features to add

### Add a front end

-Build a front end to allow customers to view available pizzas, submit pizza orders
-Build a front end to allow the pizza company to view and update the status of orders, update, delete, and add available pizzas
-Build a feature to allow for delivery

### Add features to the back end

-Add in the ability to customize a pizza (custom toppings)
-Add in a user model that would allow customers to create an account
-Adjust the order model to allow for delivery (we would need to know where to deliver the pizza)

### Or...come up with your own additional improvements
